# cecilia

## Purpose
  To provision one or more [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) with a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) installation.
  This play should then be used to keep the server updated and to manage its configurations

## Why the name?
  Random word from the Oren Tiroshâ€™s [mnemonic encoding](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918202746/http://tothink.com/mnemonic/wordlist.html) project, picked with the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://git.io/vinYi | tr ' ' '\n' | sed 's/^ *//; s/ *$//; /^$/d' | shuf -n 1
```
